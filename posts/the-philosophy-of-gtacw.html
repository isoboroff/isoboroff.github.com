    <h1>The Philosophy of GTA:CW</h1>

    <hr><small>
        Posted: <time class="published" datetime="2010-04-23T12:03:18-07:00">2010-04-23 12:03</time></small>
    <hr><p></p><p>Right now, my all-time favorite iPhone game is "Grand Theft Auto: <br>Chinatown Wars". This is my first exposure to the GTA franchise since <br>console and computer gaming were relegated to the closet of my <br>misspent youth. There are scads of reviews out there, so this won't <br>be a game review, but rather a reflection on the philosophy of the <br>gameplay of GTA:CW. </p><p></p> As the protagonist, Huang Lee, you are reminiscent of Muersault in <br>Camus' The Stranger, a figure who lives only in the present, sensing <br>the world but not empathizing with it, moving as directed by other <br>forces. You move from mission to mission without choice or <br>initiative. Determinism is the fate of experience -- you have to do <br>the missions as they are handed to you, and there are no choices to be <br>made. <p></p> Well, not completely -- there a number of side missions like taking <br>over a taxi, pretending to be a cop, and various shooting and racing <br>games, but these are absurdist, meaningless experiences -- they don't <br>affect the world outside of the mini-game. You are pressed to do <br>them, because the central story plot only accounts for about half the <br>achievable goals in the game, but they can be done at any time in any <br>order, with no effects. <p></p> You are fated to complete plot missions. The characters in the game <br>contact you with urgent messages that you come to them to do a <br>mission, but in fact you can ignore them; time has no meaning. You <br>will be late no matter when you arrive. You can spend weeks bombing <br>all the security cameras in the city, and then go back to the story, <br>and that's ok. Eventually you have to do the mission, because there <br>won't be another to do until you do it. <p></p> The game encourages a nihilistic outlook. There is a car dealership <br>where you can buy a car, and it's cheap, but it's easier to just take <br>a car off the street, and the choices are better. In fact, carjacking <br>is easier than stealing a parked car, because parked cars have to be <br>hotwired or have their alarms deactivated. So the best economic <br>option is to take the path of least morality -- an essentially <br>nihilistic philosophy. You can shoot people on the street, and that's <br>ok unless a cop is there. No action has a consequence. <p></p> You can shoot drug dealers, and they just reappear. You can also <br>carjack dealers' vans and shoot the drivers. You can gun down local <br>gang members. You can steal their cars and drive around their turf. <br>No matter how many times you do this, you can't start a gang war... <br>the gang forgets about you when you go away. In the context of a <br>mission where you make trouble for a particular gang, they are very <br>aggressive towards you, but after the mission, it's all fine. <p></p> Cops are in fact the only population in the game that reacts to your <br>choices. They only care a little bit if you commit a crime in front <br>of them. However, if you kill one, they all come after you. There <br>seems to be an infinite supply of them, as well. They are omniscient <br>-- they can tell that you are hiding in a stolen police car. However, <br>when you go into a safe house and save your game, they forget about <br>you. <p></p> Outside of the scope of a mission, the world is solipsist -- the only <br>mind that exists is you. This confused the heck out of me when Kenny <br>(your first boss) just disappeared after giving me a simple mission to <br>raise some dough. When the game does not need you to interact with a <br>character, that character is not available. They do not exist. It <br>may in fact be that you don't exist either, and the game is a <br>solipsism -- the game exists, and characters only exist when they are <br>in the story. Perhaps all computer software is solipsism. Well, <br>software in RAM. <p></p> Story characters play into the deterministic nihilism of the world. <br>One triad boss, Chan, is extremely annoying. There are missions <br>devoted solely to saving his pesky tail. However, you can't kill him <br>-- if you do, the mission fails. Later on, you do have to kill him, <br>as part of another mission. Then, it's ok. By the way, Chan's car <br>and Hsin's limo exist after they die, in their customary parking <br>spaces, so the only things in the world with independent existence are <br>those which exist to be operated by others. <p></p> Some aspects of the game philosophy is what makes it so fun to play. <br>You can wander around, explore the world, try out all kinds of crazy <br>stuff, and not worry about save points. I love this game, but <br>intellectually I'm sad that I love it. It's like loving Camus, <br>something most people do when they graduate high school. <p></p> Please, Rockstar, make me more GTA for the iPhone.
