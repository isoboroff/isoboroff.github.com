        <hr><p></p><p>I spent a couple days fighting with Firefox 3.6.8 on a fresh install of Snow Leopard.  The problem was that add-ons would not install.  Faced with life without Adblock Plus and Delicious Bookmarks, I was momentarily driven to Safari, but nevertheless needed Firefox for development.</p><p></p> Mozilla know about this problem, and even have a webpage with a solution: <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Unexpected+installation+error+-203+when+installing+add-ons">http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Unexpected+installation+error+-203+when+installing+add-ons</a>.  Unfortunately, it didn't work for me.  First, I tried removing the supposedly corrupted extensions database files from my profile.  Then, I tried creating a brand new profile.  But I still had the same error.<p></p> It turned out that restarting Firefox was not sufficient.  I had to entirely reboot my machine.  It took me a day to figure this out, because it's a Mac... I don't reboot it, ever.  Well, ok, when there's a major patch and Software Update says reboot.  But that's it.  If I want an OS that needs to reboot, I know where to find it.<p></p> So the exact steps, for me, were:<ol><li>Create a new profile.  Do this by running <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">/Applications/Firefox/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -P <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">in a terminal window.  This starts the profile manager, and you can create a brand new profile and delete your old one.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Quit Firefox.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Reboot (sigh)</span></span></li></ol><p>After logging in and starting Firefox, I could finally install extensions again.</p><p>(Edit, Aug 26) I found today that I couldn't install plugins again, same ^&amp;#(*&amp;@ error!  A reboot cleared it up.  I have no idea why this is happening... I am going to chalk it up to a bug in FF 3.6.8.</p>

        <hr><p></p><p>As with all email clients, Gnus is good for getting your email into, but slightly less good at getting your email out of. ??I have wanted to move all my email out of Gnus nnml directories and into a private IMAP server, and I actually mostly have it working.</p><p></p><div>So here are some tips.</div><p></p><div>1. Don't try to export stuff within Gnus, Emacs is just too slow for this kind of batch file processing. ??Instead, convert them to mbox format using formail(1):</div> <p></p><div>cd mail/inbox</div><div>cat [0-9]* | formail -ds &gt; inbox.mbox</div><p></p><div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">2. ??Depending on your IMAP server, you can just drop those mboxes in, or import them using a mail client. ??I couldn't figure out how to create a new group on an IMAP server within Gnus (sorry, I'm an idiot), so I just shoved a massive directory full of mboxes into Apple Mail's "Import Mailboxes..." feature, then copied them over to the IMAP server. ??This was not the best method because Mail.app is not speedy at handling tens of thousands of messages at one time. ??There is probably a bulk loader for Dovecot someplace.</span></div> <p></p><div>But the good news is that I now have a private IMAP server, which means I have easy, searchable access to my humongous stockpile of email from anywhere. ??Plus, mail gets pulled from the barfulous Exchange server as soon as possible and moved to my server.</div>

The opener was Procol Harum, who might have been ok but their sound mix was off and I couldn't parse most of the vocals.?? Fortunately, Tull was running their own board and their sound was very very good.<p></p> The lineup was:<br>Ian Anderson - flute, vocals, harmonica, acoustic guitar<br>Martin Barre - electric guitar<br>David Goodier - bass (and a most excellent Fodera 6-string, I might add!), vocals<br>John O'Hara - keys, accordion, percussion<br> Doane Perry - drums, bongos<br></div>

        <hr><p></p><p>SIGIR 2010 (<a href="http://sigir2010.org/">http://sigir2010.org/</a>) accepted 87 papers out of 520, giving a 16.7% acceptance rate. ??Is SIGIR a competitive conference? ??Is it too competitive?</p><p></p>Acceptance rate is a terrible number. ??The numerator (87) is not really free to adjust, because it is dictated by the structure of the conference, by adding sessions or tracks, or changing talk durations. ??For a conference like SIGIR with a long history, these are hard decisions to make. ??The denominator is also uncontrollable, because anyone can submit a paper; submission doesn't imply acceptable-ness. ??Thus, the acceptance rate is not useful in showing how selective a conference is, nor can you tell if the acceptance rate is good or bad, nor could a program committee do anything to change it if it wanted to.<p></p> #include&lt;disclaimers.h&gt;... I submitted a paper (with Ben Carterette) which was accepted. ??I'm a member of the 2010 senior program committee and have been either on that or the general program committee for a long time.<p></p> To my mind, the important question isn't what was the rate of acceptance over all papers, but what was the rate of acceptance over acceptable papers. ??How many reasonable papers were rejected?<p></p>SIGIR uses ConfMaster, and for the overall recommendation there is a 6-point scale. ??In SIGIR PC meetings I've been involved in, there are three sets of papers: clear accepts, clear rejects, and a bunch in the middle for which SPC members argue for or against. ??(This is clearly not a good system, because we depend on two SPC members to bring up either uninteresting papers which were clear accepts, or low-scoring papers who might have been misreviewed, but it is the system that exists. ??Interested parties should join <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sigir-meta">http://groups.google.com/group/sigir-meta</a>.) ??In general, papers are labeled accept on the basis of review scores, metareviews, and SPC discussion, by a process in which scores are a component but do not explain the full outcome. ??A straightforward competitive-acceptance-rate would compute the accept rate in the first two groups.<p></p> Let's suppose that of the 520 papers submitted to SIGIR 2010, 50 were deemed clear accepts by score average (including SPC score), and 300 were deemed clear rejects by score average. ??(In this discussion, I am making up numbers that resemble the data I have but are fudged in the interests of preserving the privacy of the SPC review process). ??170 papers are left in the middle. ??Since 87 papers were accepted, this makes the competitive-acceptance-rate 51%.<p></p> An improvement to the above process would separate SPC scores from PC scores, and drop low-confidence reviews.<p></p>Another refinement would attempt to drill down into that group of 170 discussion candidates, and also include papers in the bottom tier of 300 which were brought up for discussion. ??In some sense, this "discussion range" of papers represents the wiggle room in the acceptance rate. ??The definite-accept pile places a hard but not impenetrable ceiling on the number of accepts that can come from here -- in this case, 37 papers -- but certainly a definite-accept should be demoted in favor of a compelling discussion-range paper. ??This is hard to accomplish in SIGIR because of structural and cultural barriers, but let's assume the possibility exists. ??37/170 = a 21.7% discussion range acceptance rate, with perhaps minor changes from bottom-tier discussions and top-tier demotions. ??The discussion-range-acceptance-rate is a better measure of competitiveness because it isn't as controlled by the number of submissions.<p></p> I'll throw this open for discussion at this point, you will doubtless have better answers than I do.

             Posted: <time class="published" datetime="2010-04-23T12:03:18-07:00">2010-04-23 12:03</time></small></h1>
        <hr><p></p><p>Right now, my all-time favorite iPhone game is "Grand Theft Auto: <br>Chinatown Wars". This is my first exposure to the GTA franchise since <br>console and computer gaming were relegated to the closet of my <br>misspent youth. There are scads of reviews out there, so this won't <br>be a game review, but rather a reflection on the philosophy of the <br>gameplay of GTA:CW. </p><p></p> As the protagonist, Huang Lee, you are reminiscent of Muersault in <br>Camus' The Stranger, a figure who lives only in the present, sensing <br>the world but not empathizing with it, moving as directed by other <br>forces. You move from mission to mission without choice or <br>initiative. Determinism is the fate of experience -- you have to do <br>the missions as they are handed to you, and there are no choices to be <br>made. <p></p> Well, not completely -- there a number of side missions like taking <br>over a taxi, pretending to be a cop, and various shooting and racing <br>games, but these are absurdist, meaningless experiences -- they don't <br>affect the world outside of the mini-game. You are pressed to do <br>them, because the central story plot only accounts for about half the <br>achievable goals in the game, but they can be done at any time in any <br>order, with no effects. <p></p> You are fated to complete plot missions. The characters in the game <br>contact you with urgent messages that you come to them to do a <br>mission, but in fact you can ignore them; time has no meaning. You <br>will be late no matter when you arrive. You can spend weeks bombing <br>all the security cameras in the city, and then go back to the story, <br>and that's ok. Eventually you have to do the mission, because there <br>won't be another to do until you do it. <p></p> The game encourages a nihilistic outlook. There is a car dealership <br>where you can buy a car, and it's cheap, but it's easier to just take <br>a car off the street, and the choices are better. In fact, carjacking <br>is easier than stealing a parked car, because parked cars have to be <br>hotwired or have their alarms deactivated. So the best economic <br>option is to take the path of least morality -- an essentially <br>nihilistic philosophy. You can shoot people on the street, and that's <br>ok unless a cop is there. No action has a consequence. <p></p> You can shoot drug dealers, and they just reappear. You can also <br>carjack dealers' vans and shoot the drivers. You can gun down local <br>gang members. You can steal their cars and drive around their turf. <br>No matter how many times you do this, you can't start a gang war... <br>the gang forgets about you when you go away. In the context of a <br>mission where you make trouble for a particular gang, they are very <br>aggressive towards you, but after the mission, it's all fine. <p></p> Cops are in fact the only population in the game that reacts to your <br>choices. They only care a little bit if you commit a crime in front <br>of them. However, if you kill one, they all come after you. There <br>seems to be an infinite supply of them, as well. They are omniscient <br>-- they can tell that you are hiding in a stolen police car. However, <br>when you go into a safe house and save your game, they forget about <br>you. <p></p> Outside of the scope of a mission, the world is solipsist -- the only <br>mind that exists is you. This confused the heck out of me when Kenny <br>(your first boss) just disappeared after giving me a simple mission to <br>raise some dough. When the game does not need you to interact with a <br>character, that character is not available. They do not exist. It <br>may in fact be that you don't exist either, and the game is a <br>solipsism -- the game exists, and characters only exist when they are <br>in the story. Perhaps all computer software is solipsism. Well, <br>software in RAM. <p></p> Story characters play into the deterministic nihilism of the world. <br>One triad boss, Chan, is extremely annoying. There are missions <br>devoted solely to saving his pesky tail. However, you can't kill him <br>-- if you do, the mission fails. Later on, you do have to kill him, <br>as part of another mission. Then, it's ok. By the way, Chan's car <br>and Hsin's limo exist after they die, in their customary parking <br>spaces, so the only things in the world with independent existence are <br>those which exist to be operated by others. <p></p> Some aspects of the game philosophy is what makes it so fun to play. <br>You can wander around, explore the world, try out all kinds of crazy <br>stuff, and not worry about save points. I love this game, but <br>intellectually I'm sad that I love it. It's like loving Camus, <br>something most people do when they graduate high school. <p></p> Please, Rockstar, make me more GTA for the iPhone.

        <hr><p></p><p>I have been deploying git (<a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a>) on various systems for a few years now.  It absolutely drives me nuts that in order to have

RPMs for our new cluster, I spent a little time trying to solve this.  The toolchain is irreparable on CentOS, so the better solution is to have the git.spec file use the newly-compiled git(1) to fetch the precompiled documentation from the central git repository on <a href="http://kernel.org">kernel.org</a>, and fold that into the install.<p></p> Starting with the source RPM (<a

for the correct version of git into a directory 'manual'.  This code basically comes straight from the git INSTALL file.  The second thing is during the install phase, it copies them to the right place, and notes them for inclusion in the RPM file.<p></p> Build the rpm with the command 'rpmbuild -bb git.spec --without docs'.<p></p>I think this behavior should be the default when building '--without docs', but I don't have the patience to subscribe to the mailing list and debate patches.  Hopefully someone else will find this useful.</span></span></span></span></span>

        <hr><p></p><p>I've been thinking about the so-called Christmas bomber and all the <br>political brouhaha that has sprung up about it. What strikes me is <br>that, whatever you think of TSA security or airport security <br>generally, catching somebody like this is essentially a detection <br>problem. You can think of it as a QA process on an assembly line. <br>Some portion of the product (you, the air traveler) is sampled for <br>testing at some level (screening, hand search, etc), and some fraction <br>of those are discovered to not pass the test (drop the underwear!). </p><p></p> Any detection process has error. There are two principal types of <br>error -- misses (the Christmas bomber) and false alarms (great-aunt <br>Zelda who got strip-searched on Thanksgiving). An important <br>statistical point is that you can try to bring these error rates close <br>to zero, but the closer you get, the more you have to sample to get <br>further. Another point is that to reduce misses, you typically <br>increase false alarms. <p></p> Now, let's think about the data we know about. We have one miss <br>currently in the news. There may be some other misses we don't know <br>about. The TSA website says that "over 600 million people fly each <br>year" (domestically? world-wide?), and that they have several hundred <br>airports, several thousand screening location, and several tens of <br>thousands of screeners. We might guess that the TSA miss rate is <br>something on the order of tens out of tens or hundreds of millions in <br>a year. <p></p> We could probably draw some good guesses about the false alarm rate, <br>but I don't know where to find hard and fast numbers. We all hear <br>anecdotes and read the news stories. I think that I would qualify <br>false alarms as not just a search on a non-terrorist (eg aunt Zelda), <br>but a case where the TSA guessed that they had a terrorist and they <br>turned out to be wrong. We probably can't find those numbers out, but <br>it's probably larger than the miss rate. <p></p> Here's my point. In order to take the miss rate lower than <br>10/100,000,000, we will have to put up with much more onerous <br>screening. We don't need to take the rate to 0, but just below the <br>rate of passengers - less than 1 in 600,000,000. That's a factor of <br>60. In order to reach that factor, we would probably risk raising the <br>false alarm rate by 2-4 orders of magnitude. Which, if you think <br>about it, would probably ruin the air travel industry. <p></p> So IMO this isn't a problem that TSA can solve better than they <br>already are, without destroying the industry they are charged with <br>protecting. Technology doesn't solve it -- it also has miss and false <br>alarm rates, as well as other risks. (How many more rads do you want <br>to soak up just to fly?) <p></p> But statistics are statistics and politicians are "damn liars", two <br>things that Mark Twain placed in separate classes, so instead of real <br>thinking on this, we will instead have political bashing.

        <hr><p></p><p>I just received a new bass -- a Douglas WEB 825. These are also sold <br>by <a href="http://rondomusic.com/">http://rondomusic.com/</a>, where I bought my previous bass. Some <br>unboxing pictures are below. </p><p></p> This is just about as different as you can get from my SX 75 Jazz... <br>active preamp, bass/treble/blend/volume knob layout, 24 frets and 5 <br>strings, rosewood fretboard. It was basically the same price as the <br>Jazz, and I couldn't decide which I really wanted, so I ended up <br>buying the 825 so I could compare them. <p></p> I've only had about an hour or two to play it. The string spacing is <br>somewhat narrower than my Jazz (which is 19mm), so it's a little <br>harder to slap and to pop the middle strings. It's also a lot quieter <br>unplugged than the Jazz. I like having a full 2 octaves of frets, but <br>I don't use the top three that much, it turns out. The body is much <br>smaller than the Jazz, so it sits on the lap much lower than on the <br>strap. <p></p> The active preamp and the 2-band eq are very nice. I can get a Jazz <br>tone out of it, and a lot of other tones, just between the EQ and the <br>tone/gain on my headphone amp. I don't have a good bass amp yet, so <br>headphones are the best test so far. <p></p> All that said, I haven't made my decision yet. I really like the <br>modern look, and I think a new set of strings will help the sound <br>altogether. We'll see. I'm happy to take votes on which bass I <br>should sell! ;-)<p></p><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/qL1wjlYcXtAEZ7LSX6PZNeuDrSzaIOzUvvwDyX4rxkjoNy4olPda66omUc4M/IMG_0245.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0245" height="667" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/Gq7JPNrcEzk5sKchnm8qcHAv5iF32EOAIjH7iuZRKfQG2OK7NtQ9QNxxIiZq/IMG_0245.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a><a href="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/DoKTvcMGyG3tAPrBbLlQcJ6dbThGbuCavjfUwMw4lfZ0Gyx1Vsff5GneZR3j/IMG_0246.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0246" height="667" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/13DXSy4oOsZ4BjimzD7gcnLnRruUpKdirtvzA4ELfvdQN1sR42XTAs88PzTl/IMG_0246.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a><a href="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/9HKRGWWnExTi137vbSZSxUONpc7hTy9HBErz5Ls5Y8JM5lGDxFI4mLyWA4NI/IMG_0247.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0247" height="667" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/psAKbaMDUUlIxDTwy9pq2drrr7LT914z9fhlbEeHu8DPbEt6TUtN2prFqor7/IMG_0247.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a><a href="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/WFm4x7cqeyoo3GVSsL8hAY3f2VK1uXFDf3cTNiS1LLg0VfW9z84scWGkqL02/IMG_0248.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0248" height="667" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/NZRYMlZ0GMwHIWusLcze5dDk0m0QsYEJPugDau83LMqyv81SUQeagNGFp7qe/IMG_0248.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a></div>

        <hr><p></p><p>The call for participation for ICWSM 2010, the 4th International <br>Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, is available at <br><a href="http://icwsm.org/">http://icwsm.org/</a>. </p><p></p> Once again we will be having an open-ended data challenge. This <br>year's dataset will build on the 2009 dataset <br>(see <a href="http://icwsm.org/2009/data/">http://icwsm.org/2009/data/</a> for details), so if you already have that, you've got <br>a head start. Workshop papers will follow a similar format to last <br>year, and we will have a half-day data workshop at the end of the <br>conference featuring the best paper submissions. <p></p> This year's conference is in Washington, DC, which is sad for me <br>because I don't get to go to an exotic location, but it's great <br>because the federal government is very interested in social media <br>technologies. I hope that some government folks will be able to come <br>talk about how social media is changing the way things are done.
