<p><html><body><p>Well, it actually arrived Friday, but things have been a little busy.</p><p></p> Guitar Center in Avondale, AZ had this used Hohner B2B for sale at a very good price. I called and spoke with Eddie Rojas, who I am singling out for incredible customer service. He got the bass and told me about it over the phone, and emailed me several pictures of the bridge, pickups, and body, which seemed to show generally good condition with maybe some light finish scratches. I agreed to buy it and arranged for shipping. <p></p>  The bass arrived in a guitar box, wrapped and very well packed. And perfect looking. There is one finish blemish on an edge, but otherwise it looks brand new. The photos really highlighted textures in the poly which just aren't there. Tuners were easy to adjust, the strings didn't look too old, generally beautiful.<p></p>  I brought the strings up to tension, tuned it approximately, and left it overnight to settle in. This morning I plugged it up. Details - this is a Steinberger clone and has a licensed Steiny bridge and headpiece, but that's pretty much where the similarity ends. It has a bolt-on maple neck, rosewood fretboard, maple body with a heavy poly finish, passive P-J pickups and VVT pots. Haven't looked at the wiring but I'm not expecting any surprises.<p></p>  The tone through my little amp (Acoustic B20) was very nice, punchy E string, a very light touch. I really like the zero fret... this is my first instrument with one. Open strings sound like fretted notes. Sustain is nice but will undoubtedly be better with the new strings which are on the way. Bought a nice looking string adapter from Ebay so I can use my preferred strings (DR). With the wood construction and passive pickups, it sounds like a straight-up PJ, but is nice and small, easy to travel with, and very light on the shoulder. I find the strap position ok for now, but I tend to play with my bass pretty high up... if you like things low-slung, I can see you might want to build a strap hook to put a button out between frets 12-17.<p></p>  All in all, this is a very nice bass at what was an unbeatable price. I've seen these on the 'bay for 5-700, and the bridge itself would grab $150 at least!<p></p><p>Â </p><p></p><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/XqxYRbqyKZNujQMAVcnr8eqh9pcHxc2217wcDKqUjliHXwHcd7aJyH1be9hG/IMG_0164.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0164" height="667" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/OYX3yTSD34kiDl6LGAZ4AzmOtX7zfh3lVGULmaj0MLhfgmSOpB0x7tXWwvZH/IMG_0164.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a><a href="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/lNZIep0l6IUXe7V8dUfINfKbblWEgVEmJ2ZCfqlwL0y1EwetzomExvjQcz5K/IMG_0165.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0165" height="667" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/9QFz98PpCuZT3UKBtQzTKNcg5dRV6K7KiOMVTmcFJktf18E9dHflr2TDBVbd/IMG_0165.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a><a href="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/WAG3qm96ikiEdiEeGZ7Il4if5kWr2zqIUro1EhGuyQehsVGXTDA6JHYzeAza/IMG_0166.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0166" height="667" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/SP9GaHMHNsAvm5IhIq1Pszuo6ll0ougrczeUTJSxYeGQG2xjh1XjADY9yH2G/IMG_0166.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a></div></body></html></p>
