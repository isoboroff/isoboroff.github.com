<p><html><body><p>I went to this show last night with my father.?? In a word, the performance was astounding.?? The set opened with a jam between <a href="http://www.victorwooten.com/">Victor</a> and JD, then moved into "Me and My Bass Guitar".?? Several of Victor's children (ages 7, 9, and 12) performed with him on vocals and drums for a few songs, including an India.Arie cover and an original song by his daughter.?? Also appearing were bassist and local teacher extraordinaire <a href="http://www.bassology.net/">Anthony Wellington</a>, and his student Cole Sipe (somebody please correct my spelling if I mangled it!).?? Vic played an extended solo set including Amazing Grace, Norwegian Wood, The Lesson, and a lot of incredible loop pedal work.?? The closer was "U Can't Hold No Groove (If You Ain't Got No Pocket)".</p><p></p> Victor also shared lots of thoughts on music education, music as a language, and relationships between people of all types and backgrounds.?? He is always worth listening to.?? A good (and free) start is his visit to NPR's <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130514374">Talk of the Nation two days ago</a>.?? I am always energized and inspired when I listen to him play (especially live!).<p></p> Thanks, Victor (and all).<p></p> <p></p><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://getfile0.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/AFIotr6fsfo0QioU441ksxBCav1QBRuQbcoZo6OJM4DMO0iYiIUw3qSNFoSK/2010-10-13_22-36-29_714.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="2010-10-13_22-36-29_714" height="282" src="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/fZmmhTlhdLtI7u9prJHjWhnwnUewO7CvaT9rvpnQTXlheUz2BEhhnjwl9Mfy/2010-10-13_22-36-29_714.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a><a href="http://getfile5.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/tKkLRO0mBS1nuKQJvkCTPxm5tclibX6YB9ZJ1sxRmo0UhVzmli7EkjDnut9y/2010-10-13_22-39-21_208.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="2010-10-13_22-39-21_208" height="282" src="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/JqDNRVcy5r7aC9ki04xEihB9rILWBnaLQ29SBGByqDk8D1Jesz0PcTW4mE6c/2010-10-13_22-39-21_208.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a></div></body></html></p>
