<p><html><body><p>I've been thinking about the so-called Christmas bomber and all the <br>political brouhaha that has sprung up about it. What strikes me is <br>that, whatever you think of TSA security or airport security <br>generally, catching somebody like this is essentially a detection <br>problem. You can think of it as a QA process on an assembly line. <br>Some portion of the product (you, the air traveler) is sampled for <br>testing at some level (screening, hand search, etc), and some fraction <br>of those are discovered to not pass the test (drop the underwear!). </p><p></p> Any detection process has error. There are two principal types of <br>error -- misses (the Christmas bomber) and false alarms (great-aunt <br>Zelda who got strip-searched on Thanksgiving). An important <br>statistical point is that you can try to bring these error rates close <br>to zero, but the closer you get, the more you have to sample to get <br>further. Another point is that to reduce misses, you typically <br>increase false alarms. <p></p> Now, let's think about the data we know about. We have one miss <br>currently in the news. There may be some other misses we don't know <br>about. The TSA website says that "over 600 million people fly each <br>year" (domestically? world-wide?), and that they have several hundred <br>airports, several thousand screening location, and several tens of <br>thousands of screeners. We might guess that the TSA miss rate is <br>something on the order of tens out of tens or hundreds of millions in <br>a year. <p></p> We could probably draw some good guesses about the false alarm rate, <br>but I don't know where to find hard and fast numbers. We all hear <br>anecdotes and read the news stories. I think that I would qualify <br>false alarms as not just a search on a non-terrorist (eg aunt Zelda), <br>but a case where the TSA guessed that they had a terrorist and they <br>turned out to be wrong. We probably can't find those numbers out, but <br>it's probably larger than the miss rate. <p></p> Here's my point. In order to take the miss rate lower than <br>10/100,000,000, we will have to put up with much more onerous <br>screening. We don't need to take the rate to 0, but just below the <br>rate of passengers - less than 1 in 600,000,000. That's a factor of <br>60. In order to reach that factor, we would probably risk raising the <br>false alarm rate by 2-4 orders of magnitude. Which, if you think <br>about it, would probably ruin the air travel industry. <p></p> So IMO this isn't a problem that TSA can solve better than they <br>already are, without destroying the industry they are charged with <br>protecting. Technology doesn't solve it -- it also has miss and false <br>alarm rates, as well as other risks. (How many more rads do you want <br>to soak up just to fly?) <p></p> But statistics are statistics and politicians are "damn liars", two <br>things that Mark Twain placed in separate classes, so instead of real <br>thinking on this, we will instead have political bashing.</body></html></p>
