<p><html><body><p>The call for participation for ICWSM 2010, the 4th International <br>Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, is available at <br><a href="http://icwsm.org/">http://icwsm.org/</a>. </p><p></p> Once again we will be having an open-ended data challenge. This <br>year's dataset will build on the 2009 dataset <br>(see <a href="http://icwsm.org/2009/data/">http://icwsm.org/2009/data/</a> for details), so if you already have that, you've got <br>a head start. Workshop papers will follow a similar format to last <br>year, and we will have a half-day data workshop at the end of the <br>conference featuring the best paper submissions. <p></p> This year's conference is in Washington, DC, which is sad for me <br>because I don't get to go to an exotic location, but it's great <br>because the federal government is very interested in social media <br>technologies. I hope that some government folks will be able to come <br>talk about how social media is changing the way things are done.</body></html></p>
