<p><html><body><div class="Mentions_Input" style="">Went to see Jethro Tull at Wolf Trap last night. ??This was my first time seeing them since 1992 in Jerusalem... they have a habit of coming to DC at just the wrong times for me.<p></p>  The show was spectacular.?? Here's the setlist for any fans out there:<p></p>  Cross-Eyed Mary<br> Beggar's Farm<br> Nothing is Easy<br> New Day Yesterday<br> Pastime in Good Company (King Henry's Madrigal)<br> Jack in the Green<br> Songs from the Wood<br> Bouree<br> Hare in the Wine Cup<br> Change of Horses<br> My God<br> Budapest<br> Aqualung<br> Encore: Locomotive Breath (with a bit of Song for Jeffrey in the middle, and balloons)<p></p> Wolf Trap generally has excellent sound and polite crowds.?? The opener was Procol Harum, who might have been ok but their sound mix was off and I couldn't parse most of the vocals.?? Fortunately, Tull was running their own board and their sound was very very good.<p></p> The lineup was:<br>Ian Anderson - flute, vocals, harmonica, acoustic guitar<br>Martin Barre - electric guitar<br>David Goodier - bass (and a most excellent Fodera 6-string, I might add!), vocals<br>John O'Hara - keys, accordion, percussion<br> Doane Perry - drums, bongos<br></div></body></html></p>
