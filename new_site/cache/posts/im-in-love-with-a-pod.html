<p><html><body><p>Here's the blog post circulating from BackBlaze on their 67TB storage pod: <br> <br><a href="http://blog.backblaze.com/2009/09/01/petabytes-on-a-budget-how-to-build-cheap-cloud-storage/" target="_self">http://blog.backblaze.com/2009/09/01/petabytes-on-a-budget-how-to-build-cheap-cloud-storage/ </a><br> <br>I am in love.  Well, somewhat.  I've spent a chunk of the past year <br>spec'ing a storage cluster so that the research group I work with can <br>continue to scale to the data need of the information retrieval <br>research community.  (See <a href="http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/Data/clueweb09/">http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/Data/clueweb09/</a> <br>for what I have to work with today, and I'd like to buy something that <br>lasts for two or three years.)</p><p>My favorite graphic in the blog post shows <a href="http://blog.backblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/cost-of-a-petabyte-chart.jpg" title="dollars per petabyte" target="_blank">dollars per petabyte</a> from various vendors. </p><p>I spent a lot of time collecting similar numbers. The cluster I ended <br>up specifying is similar but uses a bunch of cluster compute nodes <br>each of which can host 5-10TB each. That's because I need CPU cycles <br>near the data; BackBlaze is just trying to solve a data problem. <br> <br>I love their solution to the data problem. NetApp sells a similar box <br>but I don't have a quote on what it costs. Anyone know? <br> <br>They are sidestepping a real problem, which is that Linux just doesn't <br>do tens of terabytes all together very well. My cluster is just a <br>Hadoop platform, but this box is no good for Hadoop, it has too many <br>disks in one place. Well, love isn't about perfection, it's about <br>reveling in the flaws, right? <br> <br>And I want my boxes in red, too. I haven't been able to get boxes in <br>nice colors since SGI.</p></body></html></p>
