<html><body><p>As with all email clients, Gnus is good for getting your email into, but slightly less good at getting your email out of. ??I have wanted to move all my email out of Gnus nnml directories and into a private IMAP server, and I actually mostly have it working.</p><p></p><div>So here are some tips.</div><p></p><div>1. Don't try to export stuff within Gnus, Emacs is just too slow for this kind of batch file processing. ??Instead, convert them to mbox format using formail(1):</div> <p></p><div>cd mail/inbox</div><div>cat [0-9]* | formail -ds &gt; inbox.mbox</div><p></p><div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">2. ??Depending on your IMAP server, you can just drop those mboxes in, or import them using a mail client. ??I couldn't figure out how to create a new group on an IMAP server within Gnus (sorry, I'm an idiot), so I just shoved a massive directory full of mboxes into Apple Mail's "Import Mailboxes..." feature, then copied them over to the IMAP server. ??This was not the best method because Mail.app is not speedy at handling tens of thousands of messages at one time. ??There is probably a bulk loader for Dovecot someplace.</span></div> <p></p><div>But the good news is that I now have a private IMAP server, which means I have easy, searchable access to my humongous stockpile of email from anywhere. ??Plus, mail gets pulled from the barfulous Exchange server as soon as possible and moved to my server.</div></body></html>
