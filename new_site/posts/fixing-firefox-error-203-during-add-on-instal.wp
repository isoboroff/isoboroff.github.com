<html><body><p>I spent a couple days fighting with Firefox 3.6.8 on a fresh install of Snow Leopard.  The problem was that add-ons would not install.  Faced with life without Adblock Plus and Delicious Bookmarks, I was momentarily driven to Safari, but nevertheless needed Firefox for development.</p><p></p> Mozilla know about this problem, and even have a webpage with a solution: <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Unexpected+installation+error+-203+when+installing+add-ons">http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Unexpected+installation+error+-203+when+installing+add-ons</a>.  Unfortunately, it didn't work for me.  First, I tried removing the supposedly corrupted extensions database files from my profile.  Then, I tried creating a brand new profile.  But I still had the same error.<p></p> It turned out that restarting Firefox was not sufficient.  I had to entirely reboot my machine.  It took me a day to figure this out, because it's a Mac... I don't reboot it, ever.  Well, ok, when there's a major patch and Software Update says reboot.  But that's it.  If I want an OS that needs to reboot, I know where to find it.<p></p> So the exact steps, for me, were:<ol><li>Create a new profile.  Do this by running <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">/Applications/Firefox/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -P <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">in a terminal window.  This starts the profile manager, and you can create a brand new profile and delete your old one.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Quit Firefox.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Reboot (sigh)</span></span></li></ol><p>After logging in and starting Firefox, I could finally install extensions again.</p><p>(Edit, Aug 26) I found today that I couldn't install plugins again, same ^&amp;#(*&amp;@ error!  A reboot cleared it up.  I have no idea why this is happening... I am going to chalk it up to a bug in FF 3.6.8.</p></body></html>
