<html><body><p>I just received a new bass -- a Douglas WEB 825. These are also sold <br>by <a href="http://rondomusic.com/">http://rondomusic.com/</a>, where I bought my previous bass. Some <br>unboxing pictures are below. </p><p></p> This is just about as different as you can get from my SX 75 Jazz... <br>active preamp, bass/treble/blend/volume knob layout, 24 frets and 5 <br>strings, rosewood fretboard. It was basically the same price as the <br>Jazz, and I couldn't decide which I really wanted, so I ended up <br>buying the 825 so I could compare them. <p></p> I've only had about an hour or two to play it. The string spacing is <br>somewhat narrower than my Jazz (which is 19mm), so it's a little <br>harder to slap and to pop the middle strings. It's also a lot quieter <br>unplugged than the Jazz. I like having a full 2 octaves of frets, but <br>I don't use the top three that much, it turns out. The body is much <br>smaller than the Jazz, so it sits on the lap much lower than on the <br>strap. <p></p> The active preamp and the 2-band eq are very nice. I can get a Jazz <br>tone out of it, and a lot of other tones, just between the EQ and the <br>tone/gain on my headphone amp. I don't have a good bass amp yet, so <br>headphones are the best test so far. <p></p> All that said, I haven't made my decision yet. I really like the <br>modern look, and I think a new set of strings will help the sound <br>altogether. We'll see. I'm happy to take votes on which bass I <br>should sell! ;-)<p></p><div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><a href="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/qL1wjlYcXtAEZ7LSX6PZNeuDrSzaIOzUvvwDyX4rxkjoNy4olPda66omUc4M/IMG_0245.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0245" height="667" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/Gq7JPNrcEzk5sKchnm8qcHAv5iF32EOAIjH7iuZRKfQG2OK7NtQ9QNxxIiZq/IMG_0245.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a><a href="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/DoKTvcMGyG3tAPrBbLlQcJ6dbThGbuCavjfUwMw4lfZ0Gyx1Vsff5GneZR3j/IMG_0246.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0246" height="667" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/13DXSy4oOsZ4BjimzD7gcnLnRruUpKdirtvzA4ELfvdQN1sR42XTAs88PzTl/IMG_0246.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a><a href="http://getfile9.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/9HKRGWWnExTi137vbSZSxUONpc7hTy9HBErz5Ls5Y8JM5lGDxFI4mLyWA4NI/IMG_0247.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0247" height="667" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/psAKbaMDUUlIxDTwy9pq2drrr7LT914z9fhlbEeHu8DPbEt6TUtN2prFqor7/IMG_0247.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a><a href="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/WFm4x7cqeyoo3GVSsL8hAY3f2VK1uXFDf3cTNiS1LLg0VfW9z84scWGkqL02/IMG_0248.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg"><img alt="Img_0248" height="667" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/pseudo/NZRYMlZ0GMwHIWusLcze5dDk0m0QsYEJPugDau83LMqyv81SUQeagNGFp7qe/IMG_0248.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500"></a></div></body></html>
