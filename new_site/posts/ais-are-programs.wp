<html><body><p>I've been reading Douglas Hofstadter's fun book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Ton_beau_de_Marot">Le Ton Beau de Marot</a>, about artificial intelligence, analogy, and translation (both machine and human).?? I've actually had it a while but like GEB it's taken me a few false starts to really push through it.?? In part of the book he recounts in broad strokes the early history of AI, and has some criticism for the school of AI research that makes grandiose, or at least heavily anthropomorphic, claims.?? I was inspired to compose the following parody, to the tune of "Parents are People" from "Free to Be You and Me".</p><p></p> AIs are Programs<br>Programs with hubris<br>When AIs were little<br>They used to be hacks<br>Like some of you<br>But then they grew<br>And now,<p></p>AIs are software<br>Really big programs<br>Burning through cycles<br> For things that they do<br> There are a lot of things<br>A lot of AIs can do.<p></p>Some AIs are planners<br>Or logical reasoners<br>Or text classifiers<br>Or music composers<br>Some AIs might find out<br>if P is NP<br>Yes AIs can be almost anything<br> We want them to be.</body></html>
