So I used to have this blog over on Posterous, but they went under, so I am attempting to migrate my content over to this new site, which uses [Github](https://github.com) pages and (Jekyll)[http://jekyllbootstrap.com].  This has the advantage that even if Github disappears, I already have a version-controlled archive of all the content.

What's here?  I had some bass reviews as well as a number of quickie tutorials on Hadoop usage with the [ClueWeb09](http://lemurproject.org/clueweb09.php/) collection from CMU.  Might branch out, might not.
